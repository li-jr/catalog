# Details about distribution  
* For DLAs, I plot the histogram which presents the distribution of DLAs in redshift/z in the constrain that z<0.8.  
* For CaII absorbers, I plot the histogram which presents the distribution of them in redshift/z in the constrain that z<0.8.  
* For MgII absorbers, I plot the histogram which presents the distribution of them in redshift/z in the constrain that z<0.8, and I also plot the histograms which present the distribution of them in W_2796 and W_2803.
